# Portfolio + Blog Combo Site Patterns

## Layout Structure
**Two-tier approach:**
- **Section 1:** Portfolio/projects showcase (featured work, case studies)
- **Section 2:** Blog feed (chronological or categorized)
- **Navigation:** Unified nav showing portfolio | blog | about | contact

## Key Patterns

### Hero Section
- Quick bio/intro + CTA linking to portfolio or latest article
- Profile image/avatar on left or integrated into background
- Tagline or value proposition

### Portfolio Section
- Featured projects with screenshot + brief description
- "Read Case Study" CTA links to dedicated blog post or case study page
- Grid layout (2-3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Project cards show: title, tech stack, impact metrics, link

### Blog Feed Section
- Article cards show excerpt + reading time + date
- Category badges or tag system
- Optional: featured/pinned articles at top
- Pagination or infinite scroll

### Navigation
- Consistent across all pages
- Quick access to main sections
- Dark mode toggle visible
- Social links in header or footer

### Footer
- Contact info or CTA
- Social media links
- Newsletter signup
- Copyright/credits

## Example Sites
- **joshwcomeau.com** - Balanced portfolio/blog with interactive explorations
- **swyx.io** - Heavy blog focus with curated projects list
- **kentcdodds.com** - Multiple content types (courses, talks, blog)

## Best Practices
1. Clear visual separation between portfolio and blog sections
2. Consistent design language and typography across sections
3. Strong internal linking (blog posts link to relevant projects, vice versa)
4. Archive/search functionality for blog content
5. Mobile-responsive layout without removing content
